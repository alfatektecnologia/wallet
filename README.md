### ZoonersWallet 

This project is part of a DOJO challenge at NearX Education. 

## Getting Started

The idea was to create a custom wallet to interact with a deployed contract created with Solidity.
This version is as simple as possible and will be refactored soon.
We have 3 screens:
- splash
- authentication(disabled at this version)
- homepage

  
You can see 2 branches and the updated one is flutterflow branch.
I will create a readme file describing the steps I used to code this app.
Do you have an android device? Download this apk file:

To others special people with iOS devices the web version is here:

Thanks!
